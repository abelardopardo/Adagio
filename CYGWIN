Executing ADA in cygwin:

The main problem in Windows is to availability of tools ported to cygwin. The
situation can be summarized as follows:

* Tools that are ONLY within cygwin. There is no possibility to install them
  as windows native applications. The main feature that these tools need to
  have in order to be used within ADA is that they accept windows like paths.
  That is, a file specified as C:\Documents and settings\blah\blah. If they
  do, then they will be used by ADA seamlessly. If they don't, the application
  is useless. ADA will invoke ant, and and invokes a native JVM which will
  ultimately produce Windows style paths.

  Example: xsltproc. Installed within cygwin but when given files with
  paths using windows syntax, the processor works fine.

* Tools that can be installed both as windows native and within cygwin. These
  are the ideal tools. The priority would be to install them within cygwin.
  If that is possible, then they fall withing the previous category. If 
  they are unable to manipulate files given with windows path syntax, then
  they should be uninstalled within cygwin and installed as windows native
  applications (which for sure they accept windows paths). 
  
  Example: LaTeX. The TeTeX distribution installs with no problem within
  cygwin, but when given paths in windows syntax, they are not processed.

* Tools installed as Windows native. They shoud give no trouble when invoked
  by ADA (that is, ANT). The tool receives files given in windows syntax but
  since they are native, there should be no problem.

  Example: Inkscape. Has a robuts installer as windows native. ADA uses it
  with no problem.
