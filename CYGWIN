The complexity of porting this tool to windows seems to be growing constantly.

So far, these are the main issues encountered (some of them unsolved).

* Cygwin offers a good subset of tools actually used by ADA. The main
  difficulty is if such tools are to be installed WITHIN the file structure
  of cygwin or as generic Windows applications. Inkscape is a good example.
  It installs flawlessly in windows and may be invoked with no problem from
  within a cygwin shell.

* The main problem is that cygwin uses "/" as path separator for all paths,
  whereas Windows uses "\" and the hard drive prefix (C:). The first problem
  appears with ANT. There are two options that have been explored:
  
  - Install ANT within cygwin. Installs fine. But when executing, since the
    JVM is installed as a windows application, none of the paths received
    by the JVM is legal, and therefore it simply bombs out trying to interpret
    the basedir path.

  - Install ANT outside cygwin as a regular windows application. In this
    case all the paths given to ANT need to contain the "\" separator and
    since the invocation is done through bash, it needs to be doubled. That
    is: ant -Dbasedir=C:\\a\\b\\c -f C:\\a\\b\\c\\build.xml

    But once this glitch is solved, the problem comes when an executable is
    invoked from ant. If such executable is within cygwin and is a symbolic
    link, the JVM will bomb out saying that the file cannot be found (take
    pdflatex as an example, it is a link pointing to pdfatex). Even if the
    executable is invoked fine from the JVM, the params will involve file
    names. These names are computed within the JVM, and therefore include
    the C:\\ notation. When received by an executable within cygwin, Boom!.

I've briefly searched for info in the net but it seems there it not much
interest on doing such thing.

* The alternative I see but haven't explored is to go 100% cygwin. This means
  install ANT and the JVM within cygwin (there is no support for such installs
  from the default cygwing config program). The same applies for the rest
  of potential tools. In some cases, though, the installation needs to be
  done from source (for example Inkscape) which raises the adoption threshold
  for Windows users.
