The following directories are obtained by combining the different contributions
by the authors in ../Material

Laboratory1: 
   2 problems taken from ../Material/Author4/*
   Three documents are produced: regular text, solutions and professor guide.

Laboratory2:
   1 problem taken from ../Material/Author5. It is bilingual, therefore
   2 versions of text, solution and professor guide need to be produced.

Theory1:
   Theory session where the slides are made available as PDF as well as
   de 2up format. This last one is produced automatically (as long as
   the pdfjam package is installed, which provides pdfnup).

A directory name scratch appears once the whole course is created. It is the
dummy copy of the site. After reviewing that everything seems correct, then
it is suitable to be published to a remote site.
