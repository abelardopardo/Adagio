The following directories are obtained by combining the different contributions
by the authors in ../Material

Laboratory1: 
   2 problems taken from ../Material/Author4/*
   Three documents are produced: regular text, solutions and professor guide.

Laboratory2:
   1 problem taken from ../Material/Author5. It is bilingual, therefore
   2 versions of text, solution and professor guide need to be produced.

Theory1:
   Theory session where the slides are made available as PDF as well as
   de 2up format. This last one is produced automatically in this directory
   and independently of the author's directory (as long as
   the pdfjam package is installed, which provides pdfnup). The author uses
   some PPT and therefore no automatic processing is done (unless we fix
   a glitch in ooffice to do batch processing efficiently)

Theory2
   Similar scenario to the previous one but the slides are obtained with
   LaTeX processing. The 2up version in this case is locally produced 
   in the author's directory. This is simply to show the two options when
   compared to the previous one.

Guide1
   This is an interesting directory. The only relevant file is Properties in
   which the variable assignment translates in an XML file and a bunch of
   png files already in a remote directory are taken and processed such that
   the result is directly produced in the scratch location. No intermediate
   file is left in this directory. This is a very special case of what can be
   done with the proper assignments. A more suitable set of assignments would
   produce a local copy and then export the appropriate files to the scratch
   directory (if you see the result, in the scratch copy there is a xsl file
   that slipped away).

A directory name scratch appears once the whole course is created. It is the
dummy copy of the site. After reviewing that everything seems correct, then
it is suitable to be published to a remote site.
