This directory has a problem. The file index.xml brings through xinclude a
file from the author area. As it is implemented right now, the set of
ant files do not detect a change in the author file to force the re-creation
of the resource. The problem is identical to the one that appears when compiling
C code and catching the dependencies introduced by the #include directive.

One possible solution is to extend the scripts to include a set of files to
look for dependencies.
