Example of Latex + Prosper slides

The slides are composed by three reusable fragments stored in
subdirectories "Forms", "RelativeURIs" and "ServletJSPIntegration".
There are also several SVG images that need to be transformed to EPS.

Subdirectory "MasterDocument" includes other files that should not be
in the author workspace in the future, when the rules for prosper are
developed, including the master file (which can be automatically
created from generic properties like title, subject, curse edition,
author, etc.), the style definition (".sty" file) and the logo.

The toolchain used for producing a PDF version of the slides is as
follows:

- transform SVGs to EPS (probably with inkscape) 
- latex $NAME dvips
- $NAME.dvi -o $NAME.ps
- ps2pdf $NAME.ps $NAME.pdf

The first step (latex) requires the *.sty file to be in the standard
locations of Latex or in the current folder where the master file is.
