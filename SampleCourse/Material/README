The Author* dirs contain the following scenarios

1.- Latex -> pdf -> pdf 2up (2up pdf file for students)

2.- Docbook + lots of pngs (screen captures) -> Guide for the students

3.- Docbook + *.svg + *.pngs (screen captures) -> Guide for the students

4.- Two problems created in subdirs:
    Problem1: docbook + svgs + code files to access. 
              Ready to generate regular doc, solutions and professor guide

    Problem2: docbook + code files
              Ready to generate regular doc, solution and professor guide

5.- Bilingual Docbook + bilingual *.svg figures.
              Ready to generate doc, solution, guide and submission page.
              Ready to generate one version per language (es, en supported)

6.- Conventional PPT file. The translation PPT to PDF is not trivial to
    automate in a generic environment (I have a macro in my ooffice instalation
    but it is not easy to guarantee such macro in any environment). It is
    then left for the user.
