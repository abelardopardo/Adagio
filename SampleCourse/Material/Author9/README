Sample material edited directly using HTML/XHTML

It could be processed with XSLT if it is well-formed XML. In order to
be well-formed, two requirements should be met:

- It should be XHTML instead of HTML.
- A root element should enclose all the XHTML content.

Both requirements are easy to meet and we can probably assume that the
author is responsible of that.
