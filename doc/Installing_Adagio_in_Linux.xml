      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed using the version control system
        <command>git</command>. The <emphasis>minimum</emphasis> set of packages
        to install and use Adagio are:</para>

        <itemizedlist id="tool_requirements">
          <listitem>
            <para><command>git-core</command>: The version control system GIT

	    <command>libxml2</command> and <command>libxslt</command>
	    libraries.</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-libxml2</command>: Python bindings for the

        </itemizedlist>

	<para>Use the software management application included in your Linux
	distribution to install these packages (the names are as they appear in
	the software repositories).</para>

	<para>Aside from these packages, there are certain tools that Adagio can
	use automatically to produce web content. See the type of resources that

    <qandaentry id="install_adagio_cli" xreflabel="How to install Adagio from
      the command interpreter">
      <question>
        <para>I got all the required packages. How do I install Adagio
        then?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed using the Version Control System tool
        <command>git</command>. Your computer needs to be connected to
        Internet. Open a command terminal, go to the folder where you want
        Adagio to be installed and type (a folder with name
        <filename>Adagio</filename> will be created):</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>git clone https://github.com/abelardopardo/Adagio.git</command></programlisting>

        <para>A new folder with name <filename>Adagio</filename> is created. In
        order to make the application available for execution, you need to
        include the path to the <filename>bin</filename> directory as part of
        your <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable. This can be done, for
        example, inserting the following command in the
        <filename>.bashrc</filename> file in your home directory:</para>

	<programlisting>PATH=/&lt;PATH_TO_ADAGIO_FOLDER&gt;/Adagio/bin:$PATH</programlisting>

	<para>After these changes, <emphasis>open a new shell window</emphasis>
	and type the command <command>which adagio</command>. A full path
	pointing to the file <filename>adagio</filename> in the
	<filename>bin</filename> folder of the recently created
	<filename>Adagio</filename> folder has to appear on the screen similar
	to what is shown in the following figure:</para>

	<programlisting>$ which adagio
/home/youruser/Adagio/bin/adagio
$</programlisting>

        <para>To make sure that the entire toolkit is properly installed and
	check which rules are active see <xref linkend="run_adagiocheck"/>.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry id="new_version_upgrade_cli" xreflabel="How to update Adagio
      from the command interpreter">
      <question>
        <para>A new version of Adagio has been published, how do I
        upgrade?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is distributed using the tool <command>git</command> which
        keeps track of the files you already have and the changes that need to
        be applied to upgrade to the latest version. The upgrade process
        requires simply to open a shell window, go to the directory where Adagio
        is installed and execute the command:</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>git pull</command></programlisting>

        <para>The command will inform in some fairly cryptic way of the changes
        that are taking place. In principle, if the source files have not been
        modified, the change will go smoothly. If you have some personal
        modifications in the source files (which we strongly advice against!)
        , you need first to tell <command>git</command> to store those
        changes. You need to execute the command:</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>git commit -a -m "Your message here"</command></programlisting>

        <para>Try again to execute <command>git pull</command>. This time, the
        update process should go smoothly. There could be some conflicts when
        <command>git</command> tries to merge these changes with the ones you
        introduced. If such situation happens, it is called a <quote>merge
        conflict</quote> and it needs to be solved manually by the user. If you
        touched Adagio source code, then we assume that you know how to solve
        merge conflicts.</para>
