      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed using the version control system
        <command>git</command>. The minimum set of packages to install and use
        Adagio are:</para>

        <itemizedlist id="tool_requirements">
          <listitem>
            <para><command>git-core</command>: The version control system GIT
            used to download, install and upgrade Adagio.</para>
          </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python</command>: the interpreter and libraries (any
	    version older than 3.0).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-lxml</command>: Python bindings for
	    <command>libxml2</command> and <command>libxslt</command>
	    libraries.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-libxml2</command>: Python bindings for the
	    GNOME XML library (needed by <command>python-lxml</command> and
	    therefore installed automatically as a dependency when installing
	    <command>python-lxml</command>).</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xml</command>: Docbook XML DTDs.</para>

          <!--   connect to remote sites.</para> -->
          <!-- </listitem> -->
        </itemizedlist>

	<para>Use the software management application included in your Linux
	distribution to install these packages (the names are as they appear in
	the software repositories).</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
        <para>I got all the required packages. How do I install Adagio
        then?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed using the Version Control System tool
        <command>git</command>. Your computer needs to be connected to
        Internet. Open a command terminal, go to the folder where you want
        Adagio to be installed and type (a folder with name
        <filename>Adagio</filename> will be created):</para>

        <programlisting><xi:include
	href="Installing_Adagio_in_Windows.xml"
	xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='git_install_command_windows']/node())"
	parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

        <para>A new folder with name <filename>Adagio</filename> is created. In
        order to make the application available for execution, you need to
        include the path to the <filename>bin</filename> directory as part of
        your <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable. This can be done, for
        example, inserting the following command in the
        <filename>.bashrc</filename> file in your home directory:</para>

	<programlisting>PATH=/&lt;PATH_TO_ADAGIO_FOLDER&gt;/Adagio/bin:$PATH</programlisting>

	<para>After these changes, <emphasis>open a new shell window</emphasis>
	and type the command <command>which adagio</command>. A full path
	pointing to the file <filename>adagio</filename> in the
	<filename>bin</filename> folder of the recently created
	<filename>Adagio</filename> folder has to appear on the screen similar
	to what is shown in the following figure:</para>

	<programlisting>$ which adagio
/home/youruser/Adagio/bin/adagio
$</programlisting>

        <para>To make sure that the entire toolkit is properly installed and
	check which rules are active see <xref linkend="run_adagiocheck"/>.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <xi:include
        href="Installing_Adagio_in_Windows.xml"
        xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='new_version_upgrade']/node())"
        parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
