      <question>
        <para>Which packages are required in Linux to use Adagio?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed using the version control system
        <command>git</command>. The required packages are:</para>

        <itemizedlist id="tool_requirements">
          <listitem>
            <para><command>git-core</command>: The version control system GIT
            used to download, install and upgrade Adagio.</para>
          </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python</command>: the interpreter and libraries (any
	    version older than 3.0).</para>

	    <command>libxml2</command> and <command>libxslt</command>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-libxml2</command>: Python bindings for the
	    GNOME XML library.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xml</command>: Docbook XML DTDs.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xsl</command>: XSL stylesheets to process
            DocBook.</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>ADA provides rules to automatically process the files produced by
	a set of tools. To fully exploit these rules, some additional tools need
	to be installed. See <xref linkend="run_adacheck"/> for more
        details.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
        <para>All the required packages are installed. How do I install
        ADA?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>ADA is installed using the Version Control System tool
        <command>git</command>. Open a command terminal, go to the folder where
        you want ADA to be installed and type:</para>

        <programlisting><xi:include
	href="Installing_Adagio_in_Windows.xml"
	xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='git_install_command_windows']/node())"
	parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

        <para>A new directory with name <filename>ADA</filename> is created. In
        order to make the application available for execution, you need to
        include the path to the <filename>bin</filename> directory as part of
        your <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable. This can be done, for
	example, inserting the following command in the
	<filename>.bashrc</filename> file in your home directory:</para>

	<programlisting>PATH=/&lt;PATH_TO_ADA_FOLDER&gt;/ADA/bin:$PATH</programlisting>
      </answer>
