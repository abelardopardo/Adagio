      <question>
	<para>How to create a document with answers to be submitted?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Creating a HTML document with one or several exercises can be
	easily done with the rules presented in the previous sections (see <xref
	linkend="docbook_processing"/>, for example). But in some cases, certain
	activities require more than one document and more importantly, the
	possibility of interfacing the documents with other platforms to submit
	answers, automatic grading, etc.</para>

	<para>ADA offers the possibility of preparing a set of files around the
	concept of <quote>exercise</quote>. The scenario that is assumed is the
	following:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The exercise needs one or more documents given to the students
	    describing the steps to obtain the answers. This document will be
	    referred to as the <quote>hand out</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_handout"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A second document, similar to the previous one but including
	    the solutions. It could be used for publication at a later stage,
	    for the teaching staff to have during class, etc. This document will
	    be referred to as the <quote>solutions</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_solution"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A third document explicitly oriented only to the teaching
	    staff including descriptions of the tasks to perform, comments,
	    evaluation criteria, etc. This document is concieved such that it
	    never is shown to the students and thus will be referred as the
	    <quote>professor guide</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_professorguide"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>An additional HTML page to submit the answers through a web
	    form. The elements to submit are derived from the included
	    exercises. The assumption is that the exercise, and the instructions
	    of what to submit are kept together. When combining several
	    exercises, the submission form contains the instructions (fields,
	    labels, etc.) of the exercises. This document will be referred to as
	    the <quote>submission page</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_submission"/> for more details).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Additional functionality to include in the documents
	    previously described such as a fixed set of fields in the submission
	    page (name, id, email, etc), a countdown to the dealine in the
	    hand-out and submission documents, a link to the evaluation
	    criteria, etc.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>The variables used in the previously described scenario suitable
	to be defined in the <filename>Properties.txt</filename> are:</para>

	<xi:include href="VarTables/ExerciseSubmit_vars.xml"
		    parse="xml"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>When used, this rule creates the previously described documents:
	hand-out, solutions, professor guide and submission page. Two stylesheet
	files are specified. The variable
	<varname>exercisesubmit.style.file</varname> is used to produce the hand
	out, solutions and professor guide document. The variable
	<varname>exercisesubmit.submit.style.file</varname> is used to obtain
	the submission page. Multilingual versions of all these documents can be
	produced using the
	<varname>exercisesubmit.multilingual.files</varname>.</para>

	<para>How to customize the hand-out document of an exercise

      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>The structure of the hand-out document is similar to the one
	obtained when using the stylesheet <filename>HeadTail.xsl</filename>
	(see <xref linkend="headtail_pararms"/> for more details). The additional
	variables to control the the style are:</para>

		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>For example, let us consider <ulink

	two exercises. With the following definitions in the <ulink

      <question>
	<para>How to produce the solution of an exercise document?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>The solution document is conceived as a document that has entirely
	the same text as the hand out but extended with annotations containing
	the solution to the posed questions. These annotations can be placed at
	only three levels of the document: section, note and phrase.</para>

	<para>To include the solution information inside a section, the
	attribute <code>condition</code> must be present in this element with
	the value <code>solution</code>. The section with this attribute is
	ignored when processing the hand out document and considered when
	processing the solution document.</para>

	<para>The inclusion of the solution information in a <code>note</code>
	element is similar to the previous one but this element is intended to
	be included at a lower level within the document (for example, inside an
	entry in a table, between two paragraphs, in a list, etc.) The presence
	of the <code>condition</code> attribute with value <code>solution</code>
	has the same effect than in the case of the <code>section</code> element
	previously described.</para>

	<para>The third method to include the solution information is to place
	it in the middle of regular text. By using the <code>phrase</code>
	element with the attribute <code>condition</code> equal to the value
	<code>solution</code>, small text strings can be interspersed through in
	the middle of a paragraph.</para>

	<para>For example, let us consider <ulink
	url="Samples/ExerciseSubmit/index.xml">a XML file</ulink> that contains
	two exercises with the information about the solutions. With the
	following definitions in the <ulink
	url="Samples/ExerciseSubmit/Properties.txt"><filename>Properties.txt</filename>

	<para>The presence or absence of the solution information is controlled
	by the following style parameter:</para>

                    parse="xml"
                    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>The rule to generate the solution document invokes the proper
	style sheet changing the value of this variable to
	<quote>yes</quote>.</para>

      <question>
	<para>How to produce the professor guide of an exercise document?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>The document called the <quote>professor guide</quote> is intended
	for the use of the teaching staff. It includes the solution information
	and special annotations and remarks not to be seen by the students. Two
	elements are prepared to encapsulate these comments: <code>note</code>
	and <code>section</code>. In both cases, the <code>condition</code>
	attribute must have the value <code>professorguide</code>.</para>

	<para>For example, let us consider <ulink
	url="Samples/ExerciseSubmit/index.xml">a XML file</ulink> that contains
	two exercises with the information to include in the professor
	guide. With the following definitions in the <ulink
