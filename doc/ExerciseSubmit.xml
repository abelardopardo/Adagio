      <question>
	<para>How to create a document with answers to be submitted?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>Creating a HTML document with one or several exercises can be
	easily done with the rules presented in the previous sections (see <xref
	linkend="docbook_processing"/>, for example). But in some cases, certain
	activities require more than one document and more importantly, the
	possibility of interfacing the documents with other platforms.</para>

	<para>ADA offers the possibility of preparing a set of files around the
	concept of <quote>exercise</quote>. The scenario that is assumed is the
	following:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The exercise needs one or more documents given to the students
	    describing the steps to obtain the required answers. This document
	    will be referred to as the <quote>hand out</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_handout"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A second document, similar to the previous one but including
	    these solutions. It could be used for publication at a later stage,
	    for the teaching staff to have during class, etc. This document will
	    be referred to as the <quote>solutions</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_solution"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>A third document explicitly oriented only to the teaching
	    staff including descriptions of the tasks to perform, comments,
	    evaluation criteria, etc. This document is concieved such that it
	    never is shown to the students and thus will be reffered as the
	    <quote>professor guide</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_professorguide"/> for more details).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>An additional HTML page to be able to submit the answers. This
	    is simply an HTML form but the elements to submit are derived from
	    the problems included in the hand out. The assumption is that when
	    designing a problem, these parts can be written next to each other
	    and through profiling, they are separated into different
	    documents. This document will be referred to as the
	    <quote>submission page</quote> (see <xref
	    linkend="exercise_submission"/> for more details).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Additional possibilities to include in these documents such as
	    a typical set of fields in the submission page, a countdown in the
	    hand-out and submission documents showing the remaining time until
	    deadline, etc.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>In the previously described scenario, the variables to be used in
	the <filename>Properties.txt</filename> are the following:</para>

	<xi:include href="VarTables/ExerciseSubmit_vars.xml"
		    parse="xml"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>If used, this rule creates the documents previously described,
	that is: hand-out, solutions, professor guide and submission page. It is
	for this reason that two stylesheet files are specified. The variable
	<varname>exercisesubmit.style.file</varname> is used to produce the hand
	out, solutions and professor guide document. The variable
	<varname>exercisesubmit.submit.style.file</varname> is used to obtain
	the submission page. Multilingual versions of all these documents can be
	produced using the
	<varname>exercisesubmit.multilingual.files</varname>.</para>
