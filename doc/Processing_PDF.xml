      <question>
	<para>How can I produce n-up PDF files?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>ADA provides a rule that given a set of PDF files produces n-up
	files, where <quote>n</quote> is a parameter. The availability of this
	rule depends on the executable <filename>pdfnup</filename> being
	properly installed in the system. The set of variables to include in the
	<filename>Properties.txt</filename> file are:</para>

	<xi:include href="VarTables/PDFnup_vars.xml"
		    parse="xml"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>For example, to produce a 2-up version of a <ulink
	url="Samples/PDFnup/Document.pdf">a PDF file</ulink>, the required
	definitions in the <ulink
	url="Samples/PDFnup/Properties.txt"><filename>Properties.txt</filename>
	file</ulink> are:</para>

	<programlisting><xi:include href="Samples/PDFnup/Properties.txt"
	parse="text"
	xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

	<para>Note that the PDF file to process may be produced by another ADA
	rule.</para>

      <question>
	<para>How to translate automatically Microsoft PowerPoint or Word files
	to PDF?</para>
      </question>
      
      <answer>

	<para>WARNING: This functionality is still in Beta. ADA has a rule to
	invoke OpenOffice directly and produce a PDF file from either a
	PowerPoint or a Word file. The functionality relies on a specific macro
	being available in a properly installed OpenOffice instance. The
	variables to control this rule are:</para>

	<xi:include href="VarTables/Msf2PDF_vars.xml"
		    parse="xml"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>Note that this rule does not allow to control where the newly
	produced PDF are stored. It is assumed that the same directory of the
	source file is considered.</para>

    <qandaentry id="ps2pdf">
      <question>
	<para>How can I translate Postscript to PDF?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>ADA includes a rule to translate a set of given Postscript files
	to PDF. The variables to include in the
	<filename>Properties.txt</filename> file are:</para>

	<xi:include href="VarTables/Ps2pdf_vars.xml"
		    parse="xml"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

	<para>For example, given a <ulink
	url="Samples/Ps2pdf/Document.ps">PostScript file</ulink>, the content of
	the <ulink
	url="Samples/Ps2pdf/Properties.txt"><filename>Properties.txt</filename>
	file</ulink> should include the definitions:</para>

	<programlisting><xi:include href="Samples/Ps2pdf/Properties.txt"
		    parse="text"
		    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

	
	<para>Note that the rule can only be applied if the proper translation
	tool is installed in the system.</para>
