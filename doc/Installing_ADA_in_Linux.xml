  <title>Installing ADA in Linux</title>

      <question>
        <para>Which packages are required to use ADA in Linux?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          ADA uses primarily <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</ulink>,
          and it is distributed using <command>git</command>. The bare minimum
          required packages are: <command>Ant</command>, a Java run-time
          environment (JRE) and <command>git</command>.
        </para>

        <para>
          But to fully exploit ADA functionality, there are additional tools
          that need to be installed. See <xref linkend="run_adacheck"/> for
          more details.
        </para>
      </answer>

      <question>
        <para>
          Once I installed all the required packages, How do I install
          ADA?
        </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          ADA is distributed using the <command>git</command> version control
          tool. Open a terminal and type the command:
        </para>

        <xi:include 
	  href="Installing_ADA_in_Windows.xml"
	  xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='git_install_command'])"
	  parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
        
        <para>
          A new directory with name <filename>ADA</filename> will be
          created. In order to make ADA available, you need to include the
          path to its <filename>bin</filename> directory as part of your
          <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable.
        </para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <xi:include 
      href="Installing_ADA_in_Windows.xml"
      xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='no_catalogs'])"
      parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
