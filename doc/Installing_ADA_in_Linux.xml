  <title>Installing ADA in Linux</title>

      <question>
        <para>Which packages are required to use ADA in Linux?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>ADA needs to execute the <ulink
        url="http://www.python.org">Python</ulink> interpreter. Also, the
        application can be installed using <command>git</command>. Additionally,
        the styles to process Docbook files included in ADA are extensions to
        the Docbook XSL Stylesheets created by Bob Stayton and Norman
        Walsh. Thus, the recommended packages to install (with their
	correspondign dependencies) are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>Python</command>: the interpreter and
	    libraries.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-lxml</command>: Python bindings for
	    <command>libxml2</command> and <command>libxslt</command>
	    libraries.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-libxml2</command>: Python bindings for the
	    GNOME XML library.</para>
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>git</command>: Fast version control system used to
            download the latest ADA version.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xml</command>: Docbook XML DTDs.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xsl</command>: XSL stylesheets to process
            DocBook.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>openssh-client</command>: SSH client program to
            connect to remote sites.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>ADA</command>: contains the python scripts to process
            the source files (installed with <command>git</command>).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>ADA provides rules to automatically process the files produced by
	a set of tools. To fully exploit these rules, some additional tools need
	to be installed. See <xref linkend="run_adacheck"/> for more
        details.</para>

      <question>
        <para>
          Once I installed all the required packages, How do I install
          ADA?
        </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          ADA is distributed using the <command>git</command> version control
          tool. Open a terminal and type the command:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
          <xi:include
            href="Installing_ADA_in_Windows.xml"
            xpointer="xpointer(//*[@id='git_install_command_windows']/node())"
            parse="xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
        </programlisting>

        <para>
          A new directory with name <filename>ADA</filename> will be
          created. In order to make ADA available, you need to include the
          path to its <filename>bin</filename> directory as part of your
          <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable.
