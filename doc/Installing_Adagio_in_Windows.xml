    <qandaentry id="requiredapplicationsinwindows" xreflabel="Basic packages to
      run Adagio">
      <question>
        <para>Which packages are needed in Windows before installing
        Adagio?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Adagio is installed, updated, managed and executed using the
        version control system <command>git</command>. The minimum set of
        packages to use Adagio are:</para>

        <itemizedlist id="tool_requirements">
          <listitem>
            <para><command>msysgit</command>: The windows version of GIT a Fast
            version control system used to download the latest Adagio version
            and its command interpreter is used to execute adagio.</para>

	    <para>Go to the <ulink
	    url="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit project
	    page</ulink>, download the installer (link to a file with extention
	    <quote>exe</quote> in the left side of the page), execute it in your
	    machine and you have GIT installed.</para>

	    <para>There are two possible execution modes: a command interpreter
	    (icon with name <quote>Git Bash</quote>), and a graphical interface
	    (icon with name <quote>Git Gui</quote>). All Git operations can be
	    done with both interfaces. However, the command interface has a
	    configuration that, when combined with the following packages,
	    creates the ideal setting to use Adagio. For this reason, all the
	    commands to perform operations with Adagio must be executed using
	    the interpreter provided by GIT.</para>
          </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>Python</command>: The interpreter of a programming
	    language and its corresponding libraries.</para>

	    <para>Go to the <ulink url="http://www.python.org/getit/">Python
	    download page</ulink>. Download the windows installer for version
	    2.7.2 (do NOT download any version beyond this one) and perform the
	    installation by executing it. Python is ready to be executed in your
	    computer.</para>

	    <para>But Adagio needs the Python installation directory to be part
	    of the <command>PATH</command> environment variable. If Python is
	    installed in the folder <filename>C:\Python27</filename>, the string
	    <quote>;C:\Python27</quote> must be appended to the
	    <command>PATH</command> environment variable. See <xref
	    linkend="manage_environment_variables_windows"/> and follow the
	    steps to perform this configuration.</para>

	    <para>Once the environment variable has been modified, we check that
	    Python is properly installed by opening the Git Bash window and
	    typing the command:</para>

	    <programlisting>$ <command>python --version</command>
Python 2.7.2
$</programlisting>

            <para>The current Python version number should appear on the
            screen.</para>

	    <para>Next, we need to enhance the Python installation with
	    capability to import some additional libraries. Download the <ulink
	    url="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py"><filename>ez_setup.py</filename></ulink>
	    to a known location in your computer. Open the Git Bash, go to the
	    folder where the scripit <filename>ez_setup.py</filename> is stored
	    and type the command:</para>

	    <programlisting>python ez_setup.py</programlisting>

	    <para>Several messages appear on the screen notifying that some
	    additional scripts are being installed, as shown in the following
	    figure.</para>

	    <informalfigure>
	      <mediaobject>
		<imageobject>
		  <imagedata fileref="images/ez_install.jpeg"/>
		</imageobject>
		<textobject>
		  <phrase>Installation of the <filename>ez_install</filename>
		  script.</phrase>
		</textobject>
	      </mediaobject>
	    </informalfigure>
	
	    <para>Your Python installation is now ready to install some
	    additional libraries.</para> 
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><command>python-lxml</command> and
	    <command>python-libxml2</command>: Python bindings for
	    <command>libxml2</command>, the GNOME XML library and
	    <command>libxslt</command> libraries.</para>

	    <para>Open the Git Bash and go to the folder
	    <filename>Scripts</filename> inside the folder where Python has been
	    installed (something similar to
	    <filename>/c/Python27/Scripts</filename>). Execute the following
	    command:</para>
	    
	    <programlisting>easy_install lxml</programlisting>

	    <para>A few messages appear on the screen notifying that the
	    <filename>lxml</filename> library is installed as shown in the
	    following figure.</para>

	    <informalfigure>
	      <mediaobject>
		<imageobject>

	      </mediaobject>
	    </informalfigure>
	
	    <para>Python is now fully installed and ready to be used by
	    Adagio.</para>
	  </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xml</command>: Docbook XML DTDs.</para>

	    <para>Download <ulink
	    url="http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.5/docbook-xml-4.5.zip">version 4.5
	    of the Docbook DTDs</ulink> and expand its content in a folder named
	    <filename>docbook-xml</filename> inside the folder where Adagio has
	    been installed. Verify that the file
	    <filename>docbookx.dtd</filename> is present in the path
	    <filename>/c/Users/you.../Adagio/docbook-xml/docbookx.dtd</filename>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><command>docbook-xsl</command>: XSL stylesheets to process
            DocBook.</para>

	    <para>Download <ulink
	    url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/">the
	    latest version of the Docbook XSL stylesheets</ulink>. Select the
	    proper folder and download the file with name similar to
	    <filename>docbook-xsl-*.*.zip</filename>. Expand its content into a
	    folder with name <filename>docbook-xsl</filename> also inside the
	    folder where Adagio is installed.</para>

	    <para>After this step, the files in the folder where Adagio is
	    installed should look similar to the following figure.</para>

	    <informalfigure>
	      <mediaobject>
		<imageobject>
		  <imagedata fileref="images/adagio_folder_with_extras.jpeg"/>

          <!--   connect to remote sites.</para> -->
          <!-- </listitem> -->
        </itemizedlist>

	<para>Aside from these packages, there are certain tools that Adagio can
	use automatically to produce web content. See the type of resources that
	can be processed in <xref linkend="Processing_resources_with_Adagio"
	endterm="Processing_resources_with_Adagio_title"/>.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry id="howtoinstallpackages" xreflabel="How to install other packages">
      <question>
        <para>I got all the required packages. What else is required to run
        Adagio?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Once all the packages described in <xref
        linkend="requiredapplicationsinwindows"/> are installed, you need to
        install the Adagio toolkit using GIT. This installation can be done
        either with the GIT Bash interface (see <xref
        linkend="install_adagio_cli"/>) or using the graphical interface as
        described next.</para>

	<para>Open the GIT Gui, select the option to clone a remote
	repository. Type the following URL as Source Location:</para>

	<programlisting>git@github.com:abelardopardo/Adagio.git</programlisting>
	<para>Select the name of a folder to be created when installing
	Adagio.</para>
	
	<para>Proceed with the cloning. After a while a new folder is created in
	the location you specified containing the toolkit and the graphical
	interface window is ready to execute any operation.</para>

	<para>We need to add the folder <filename>bin</filename> to the
	<command>PATH</command> environment variable. If you installed Adagio,
	for example, in <filename>C:\Users\you\Adagio</filename>, you need to
	add the string <quote>;C:\Users\you\Adagio\bin</quote> to the
	<command>PATH</command> variable. See <xref
	linkend="manage_environment_variables_windows"/> and follow the steps to
	perform this configuration.</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry id="adagio_update_windows">
      <question>
        <para>A new version of Adagio has been published, how do I
        upgrade?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>There are two ways to obtain the new version: using the Git Bash
	and with the graphic interface. To update using the Git Bash read <xref
	linkend="new_version_upgrade_cli"/>.</para>

	<para>To update Adagio using the graphic interface, open the repository
	where Adagio is installed. Select the menu option
	<command>Remote-&gt;Fetch from-&gt;origin</command>. A screen similar to
	the one shown in the following figure will appear.</para>

        <informalfigure>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/GitFetchGUI.jpeg"/>
            </imageobject>
            <textobject>
              <phrase>Result of the <quote>fetch</quote> operation.</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>

	<para>This <quote>fetch</quote> step brings the changes to you computer
	but does not merge them with your current version. To perform this
	merging you need to select the option <command>Merge-&gt;Local
	merge...</command> and select the remote branch identified by
	<command>origin/master</command> as shown in the following
	figure.</para>

        <informalfigure>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/GitMergeGUI.jpeg"/>
            </imageobject>
            <textobject>
              <phrase>Result of the <quote>merge</quote> operation.</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>

	<para>As a result, your Adagio code will be set to the latest released
	version of the toolkit.</para>
