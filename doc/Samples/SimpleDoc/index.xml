    Subversion is a tool used to store copies of a set of directories and files
    in a remote repository. Such repository is used mainly for two tasks: share
    these files with other users, and keep all different versions of these files
    during time. This type of tools are known generically as <quote>version
    control tools</quote> and are used quite frequently in industrial
    environments because they usually require sharing files among team members
    and keep all the changes perfectly stored. In order to use such tool two
    programs need to be installed, although for a regular user, only one of them
    is required.
